# splash-screen-

whenever an application is launched, Company logo (mostly) or an image appears on the screen for a few seconds. During this time, 
Many a times few http (web) calls are made for connection to the server. Rest of the times, it is used for promotional purposes. 

Hence in this repo, I have created a fragment which can be used as it is (small modifications for changing the package name, image to be visible etc). Also a small tutorial will also be published along with which will help you understand the codes.

Cheers! Happy coding!
